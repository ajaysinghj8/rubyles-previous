## Running Locally

### Web / Front-end
The following command will startup the front-end and automaticaly open the homepage in the browser:

```
cd web
npm start
```

### API
At the moment, the API is not actually used by the frontend. But here's the command to start it anyway:

```
cd api
node index.js
```

After starting it, you can see the returned JSON here: http://127.0.0.1:3000/transactions
